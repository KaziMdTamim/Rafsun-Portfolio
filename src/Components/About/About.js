          Over the last five years, I have been working as a young Creative Designer, Entrepreneur, Writer, Freelance Designer from Bangladesh. I always work for my own spiritual satisfaction. The satisfaction I find comes from my design works, story writing or any new innovative thinking.

          <br />

          I have developed myself as a freelance creative designer and started my journey with some of the national and international platforms of the world when I was a high school student.

          In addition to the national and international platform, I also worked with some of the leading online brands, corporate companies in Bangladesh as a creative designer.

          <br />

          After all, I founded Grafx69, an online-based creative design studio. Team Grafx69 is an assembler of some talented professional designers. Grafx69 has risen to be one of the most mentionable Creative Design Agency.

          Moreover, I'm currently leading an initiative to alleviate the suffering of girls during periods. We have launched a service called Bondhu Time. Bondhu Time is the largest online health-conscious products service shop in Bangladesh. We maintain your precious privacy and deliver your expected products. We deliver pads and accessories to them ahead of time every month, keeping an eye on the period circle of girls.

          I consider myself lucky to have such an opportunity in my student life. I have many more plans that I want to work on in the future. I want to do something good for the country as a child of Bangladesh. As much as I can afford it, I want to stand by the people of my country which will help me to be a better person.
